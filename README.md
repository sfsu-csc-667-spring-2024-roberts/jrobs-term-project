### Adding some organization for routes

Created the `backend/routes` directory and moved the route logic from [`backend/server.js`](/backend/server.js) to [`backend/routes/root.js`](/backend/routes/root.js). Set up the root routes in [`backend/server.js`](/backend/server.js) to serve all routes defined in [`backend/routes/root.js`](/backend/routes/root.js) from the root of the site (`/`).

### Adding our first route

Write the basic server setup code in [`backend/server.js`](/backend/server.js) to get a simple route set up. Updated [`package.json`](./package.json) to be able to use ES6.

### Initial project setup

Created a `backend` directory where all of our server side source code will go, and the [`server.js`](/backend/server.js) file where we will write our server configuration code.

Install the express dependency with:

```
npm install express
```
